# Claude Memory - Johnathan-agent Project

## Johnathan-agent Project

This is an educational project to build an AI agent CLI while learning the concepts.

**Always reference these files at the start of sessions:**
- `AI_JOURNAL.md` - Read this first for context on what we've done and where we are
- `TOPICS.md` - Current progress checklist, update when topics are completed
- `LEARNING_PLAN.md` - Full curriculum and topic structure

**Workflow for each topic:**
1. Present the concept
2. Relate it to the codebase
3. Explain the theory
4. Implement together
5. Review the implementation

**After each session:** Update AI_JOURNAL.md with what we covered, decisions made, and next steps.

**Tool output is suppressed.** All Edit, Write, Read, Glob, Grep, and Bash outputs are hidden. Always:
- Explain what you're changing/reading and why
- Describe command results (compiled successfully, program output, errors)
- Summarize search results rather than showing raw output
